During this thesis, there were analyzed both fundamental concepts of web applications, including the different architectural approaches and historical references, and the two most popular front-end tools for building web projects, React and AngularJS. The main purpose was to compare ReactJS and Angular, a frequently defined question among newcomer companies and developers. This comparison took place based on different metrics that cite each framework/library's advantages and disadvantages.

\section{Future Work}
To complete ReactJS and Angular's comparison in all possible perspectives, performance needs to examined and proven. In future work, creating the same application in both client-side tools can provide an equal and more objective correlation. In this sense, I aim to build my app, Hom-e, which is developed in Angular, in React as well and then check the performance and user experience of both apps.
