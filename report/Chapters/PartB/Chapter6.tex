During this thesis, there were analyzed both fundamental concepts of web applications, including the different architectural approaches and historical references, and the two most popular front-end tools for building web projects, React and AngularJS. The main purpose was to compare ReactJS and Angular, a frequently defined question among newcomer companies and developers. This comparison took place based on different metrics that cite each framework/library’s advantages and disadvantages. \par

\section{Future Work}
To complete ReactJS and Angular’s comparison in all possible perspectives, performance and user experience needs to be examined. In future work, creating the same application in both client-side tools can provide an equal and more objective correlation. In this sense, I aim to build in React Hom-e, an app developed by me and one of my colleagues and is currently in Angular. \par
